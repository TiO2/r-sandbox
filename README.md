## Create a GitHub Account

## Fork this repository

Once your fork the repository, any changes you make to your fork will not affect this repository. This lets you add or change anything you like without fear of changing things for others. (If you think we should change something, submit a Pull Request: [Creating a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)).

## Setup GitHub Pages for your forked repository

## Customization

Now that you have set up your repository, you can edit the HTML for each file as you would a normal webpage, and when you commit the changes to your *master* branch they will propagate to the github.io pages.

## Done! 

That's it! You can now navigate to *[your-username].github.io/r-sandbox* to view the main page, and *[your-username].github.io/r-sandbox/quiz-sandbox*, *[your-username].github.io/r-sandbox/class-page*, etc. for the sub pages.
